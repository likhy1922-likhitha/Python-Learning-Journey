The ######, ######, ###, ###, and ##### lived near the farm.
The ###### and the ### were noisy, while the ### was quiet.
Every morning, the ###### teased the ###### and the ### chased the ###.
At night, the ##### rested, the ###### slept, the ### guarded the farm, and the ###### played again.
The ### watched the ######, the ######, the ###, and the ##### silently.
