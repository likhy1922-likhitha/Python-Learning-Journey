## Python Learning Journey

I built this repository to track my weekly progress while learning Python through hands-on practice, problem-solving, and mini projects. Each week focuses on strengthening core concepts and applying them through real code.

## Week 1 – Python Basics

I learned the fundamentals of Python programming, including how the language is structured and how basic data types work.

Worked with modules and wrote clean comments

Used variables, data types, and operators effectively

Practiced string operations and formatting

Managed data using lists and tuples

Organized information using dictionaries and sets

## Week 2 – Intermediate Concepts

I focused on writing logical programs and improving problem-solving skills using conditions, loops, and functions.

Implemented conditional expressions for decision-making

Used loops to automate repetitive tasks

Created reusable functions

Mini Projects

Built a Snake Water Gun game using conditional logic

Developed an ATM simulation to practice real-world scenarios

Games

Created a quiz application

Built Rock Paper Scissors

Simulated dice rolls

Developed a number guessing game

## Week 3 – File Handling & Object-Oriented Programming

I worked with files and applied object-oriented programming principles to write structured and maintainable code.

Read from and wrote data to files

Used append mode and the with statement safely

Solved multiple file-handling practice problems

Created classes and objects

Implemented constructors and used the self keyword

Differentiated between instance and class attributes

Applied static methods

Practiced OOP concepts through small programs
